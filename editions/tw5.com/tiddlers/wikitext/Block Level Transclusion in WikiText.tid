! Single Block Transclusion

You can transclude a single anchored block from another tiddler using `{{Title^anchor}}`.

For example, the [[Block Level Links in WikiText]] tiddler has a section marked `^linkSection`. You can transclude only that section:

```
{{Block Level Links in WikiText^linkSection}}
```

This renders only the block with anchor `linkSection`, not the entire tiddler.

! Range Transclusion

You can transclude a range of consecutive blocks using `{{Title^startAnchor^endAnchor}}`.

Anchor ids cannot contain `^`, so the second `^` unambiguously introduces the end anchor.

For example, given a tiddler "MyNotes" with content:

```
First paragraph. ^intro

Second paragraph. ^details

Third paragraph. ^conclusion
```

Transclude from `^intro` to `^details` inclusive:

```
{{MyNotes^intro^details}}
```

This renders the first and second paragraphs, but not the third.

! Transclusion of Different Block Types

Anchor transclusion works with all block types that support anchors — paragraphs, headings, code blocks (`` ```lang ^id ``), quote blocks (`<<< ^id`), and list items (`* item ^id`).

If the referenced anchor does not exist in the target tiddler, the full tiddler content is rendered as a fallback.

! Important Notes

* Do ''not'' transclude a tiddler's own anchored blocks from within that same tiddler (e.g., `{{MyTiddler^block}}` inside `MyTiddler`) — this causes a recursive transclusion error.
* Note: the qualified DOM `id` attribute uses `TiddlerTitle^^anchorId` (double caret) as a namespace separator — this is an HTML attribute value, not wikitext syntax, and does not conflict with the single `^` used in wikitext references.
* See [[Block Level Links in WikiText]] for how to add anchors to blocks.
