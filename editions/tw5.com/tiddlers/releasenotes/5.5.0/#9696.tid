The [[RevealWidget]] popup now stays within its container by default. The existing `clamp` attribute gains a new value `"auto"` which becomes the default:

* Prefers the requested `position` direction
* Flips to the opposite direction (e.g. `below` → `above`) when the preferred side would overflow the container
* Shifts along both axes so the popup fits entirely within the container
* For absolutely-positioned popups the boundary is the visible viewport

The legacy `clamp` values `right`, `bottom` and `both` are unchanged. Use `clamp="none"` to reproduce the pre-5.5.0 behaviour of exact fixed-direction placement without any adjustment.
