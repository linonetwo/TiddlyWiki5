title: $:/plugins/tiddlywiki/core-api-docs/readme

This plugin provides the human-readable reference documentation for core filter operators and widgets, migrated from the tw5.com edition.

Documentation pages keep their original titles (e.g. ''contains Operator'', ''ActionNavigateWidget'') to preserve links, but structured metadata fields (such as `op-purpose`, `op-input`, etc.) have been moved to the `core-api-attributes` plugin under the `$:/docs/` namespace.

The rendering templates in this plugin read from `$:/docs/...` attribute tiddlers so that both the documentation site and visual editors share the same structured data source.
